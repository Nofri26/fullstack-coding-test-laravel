## About the Application

This application is built using Laravel. The structure follows Laravel general structure (MVC), with an additional pattern for controllers, such as using Requests for form validation. The RESTfull API is implemented using Sanctum. I did not encounter any difficulties during development, but I faced challenges during deployment since I have never deployed a project professionallyâ€”only as personal projects.
